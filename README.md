# Introduction

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists.  

For this project, we will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

# Libraries

The following python libraries were used for the analysis

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- statmodels
- sklearn

# Data

The data is in the csv format that was provided by Udacity. Project guidelines were also provided by Udacity.
